 ## Download instructions
 Unfortulately, this application is Windows exclusive. But, for the people on Windows: Download the latest release and 'englishWords.dat'. Make sure that **englishWords.dat is located in the same directory as that of the executable.**
 
 ## How to Use
 - Make a good initial guess. (I highly recommend that you start with 'AROSE').
 - Type all green and orange letters in the 'Letters to include:' text box.
 - Type all letters which are not green or orange **and** are gray in the 'Letters to exclude:' text box.
 - Type the letters in **green** (could be across guesses) at their correct positions in the 'Letters in their correct positions:' text box. Use the character '.' to indicate no knowledge of the letter which goes in that position.
 - Type the letters in **orange** (could be across guesses) which are in the word, but at incorrect positions in the 'Letters in their incorrect positions:' text box. Use the character '.' to indicate no knowledge of the letter which does not go in that position.
 - Go through the 'Best Guesses' suggested by the application. Pick any one of them, preferably the one you think is more common.
